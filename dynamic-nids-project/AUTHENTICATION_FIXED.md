# 🔐 Authentication Issue Fixed!

## ✅ Problem Solved

The 404 error on `/token` endpoint has been **completely resolved**! 

### 🔍 What Was Wrong:
- Frontend was trying to authenticate with `/token` endpoint
- The minimal backend (`main_ml_minimal.py`) didn't include authentication
- This caused 404 errors when trying to login

### 🛠️ What Was Fixed:
1. **Created** `main_ml_with_auth.py` - Backend with full authentication
2. **Updated** startup scripts to use authenticated backend
3. **Added** demo credentials for easy testing
4. **Tested** all authentication endpoints

## 🎯 Authentication Details

### Demo Credentials:
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`

### Available Endpoints:
- ✅ `POST /token` - Login endpoint (now working!)
- ✅ `GET /users/me` - User info endpoint
- ✅ All other API endpoints with auth protection

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Use Updated Launcher (Recommended)
1. **Double-click**: `🚀 Start NIDS.bat`
2. **Login** with: admin / admin123
3. **Enjoy** the full NIDS experience!

### Option 2: Manual Backend Start
```bash
# Start authenticated backend
start-backend-with-auth.bat

# Or directly:
cd backend
python main_ml_with_auth.py
```

## 🧪 Verification
